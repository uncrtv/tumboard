tumboard: Keyboard shortcuts for Tumblr dashboard
=================================================
Created this because I find Tumblr's j and k wholly insufficient.
And because I 'like' a lot of post, and can't be bothered to reach
my mouse.

List of supported browsers:
---------------------------
 * Safari only, for now. Tested on Safari 5.1.1 (Lion). I can't
test on older versions of Safari because I don't have a spare
Mac (or PC for that matter).
 * I intend to extend this to Chrome in the very near future.

List of keyboard shortcuts:
---------------------------
 * D: Go back to page 1 of dashboard. 
 * j: Scroll down a post.
 * J: Scroll to last post in page.
 * k: Scroll up a post.
 * K: Scroll to first post in a page.
 * i: Scroll to post currently selected.
 * l: "Like"/heart a post.
 * r: Reblog a post.
 * R: Reply to post (if applicable).
 * n: Show post's notes.
 * e: Expand inline images.
 * o: Open post's permalink in new window/tab.

To install:
-----------
You can go to the __Download__ tab, where there's a packaged v0.2.
Download a copy and double click to install. Auto-updating is currently
__not__ available as I don't have a server to host the manifest
(or even the extension itself) ;~;

Maybe I'll use GitHub Pages.

Who am I?

My name is Tom, and I'm a fabulous cat. Meow!
